### **Project Spec: Electric Shade Pre-Wire ("Router & Rescue" - Tadpole Variation)**

**Goal:** Invisible, retrievable infrastructure for KNX 24V DC Shades (Dual-Motor Ready).
**Wall Finish:** Drywall + Spray Foam (No Conduit).

---

### **1. Material List**

* **Cable:** 16/4 (16 AWG, 4-Conductor) **Stranded & Shielded**.
* *Spec:* Plenum or CL3 rated (In-Wall).


* **Protection (Armor):** 1/8" thick Steel Flat Bar (1/2" or 3/4" wide).
* **Sealant:** Blue Painter’s Tape (to seal assembly against mud).
* **Backer:** Thin cardboard (cereal box thickness) or stiff tape for the "Vault" cover.

### **2. Placement & Dimensions**

* **Vertical Location:** Underside of window header (the horizontal surface facing the floor).
* **Horizontal Location:** **Corner** of the window (Left or Right side).
* *Note:* Coordinate with shade order plan (Left motor vs Right motor).


* **Offset (Depth):** Center the channel **2 inches back** from the room-face of the header.
* *Why:* Keeps wire safe from drywall screws which typically hit the first 1" of the header edge.



### **3. The "Router & Rescue" Procedure**

**Step 1: The Anchor (Drill)**

* Drill a **3/8" hole** vertically through the header/top-plates to the attic.
* **Location:** Drill this hole approximately **16 inches away** from the vertical king stud (jamb).
* *Action:* Pull the 16/4 wire down through this hole.

**Step 2: The Channel (Router - "The Tadpole")**

* **The Tail:** Route a channel starting from your drill hole and running toward the corner.
* *Width:* 3/8" (Standard).
* *Depth:* 1/2".


* **The Head (The Vault):** When you get within **3 inches of the corner**, widen the cut to create a pocket.
* *Width:* **1.5 inches**.
* *Depth:* **3/4 inch** (Go slightly deeper here to fit future connectors).
* *Length:* Run this wide pocket right to the King Stud/Corner.



**Step 3: Installation (The Split-Plate)**

* **Lay Wire:** Place wire in the bottom of the channel. **Do not staple.**
* **Plate A (The Shield):** Cut a steel strip to cover the "Tail" section only (protecting the main wire run).
* **The Vault:** Leave the "Head" (the wide pocket at the corner) **empty of steel**.
* *Note:* This empty "air pocket" allows you to punch through the drywall later to find the wire, and gives you space to tuck Wago connectors back in later.


* **Secure:** Tape the steel strip down so it doesn't move.

**Step 4: Seal & Record**

* **Cover:** Tape a piece of cardboard over the "Vault" (so drywall mud doesn't fill the deep pocket).
* **Seal:** Apply Blue Tape over the *entire* assembly (Steel Tail + Cardboard Head).
* **Photo:** Take a clear photo with a tape measure showing the exact location of the channel relative to the corner.

### **4. Future Retrieval (Post-Paint)**

1. **Scan:** Use a magnet to find the steel strip. Follow it toward the corner until the magnet "drops off."
2. **Punch:** You are now over the 1.5" wide "Vault." Punch through the drywall with a small screwdriver.
3. **Pull:** Hook the wire connector and slide the full **16 inches of slack** out of the wall.
4. **Connect & Tuck:** After connecting the motor, push the wire nuts/Wagos back into the "Vault" for a completely flush finish.
