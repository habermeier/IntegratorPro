## Current Phase and Status
**Phase**: P13 - Solid Placement and Label Polish
**Status**: IN-PROGRESS
**Commit History**: P12 completed.

## Active Worker Assignments
- **Worker 1 (SYMBOL-CLIPPING-FIX-P13)**: Ensuring symbol shorthands are not cut off.
- **Worker 2 (LABEL-OFFSET-P13)**: Relocating 3D labels to bottom-right of symbols.
- **Worker 3 (PLACEMENT-POLISH-P13)**: Functional audit of the multi-layer device system (Placement -> Save -> Load).

## Pending Issues / Blockers
- **Functional**: Placement tool needs to be 100% reliable across all technical layers.
- **Visual**: Shorthand labels currently overlap or get clipped.

1. **Cable Snapping**: Docking cables to device centers.
2. **Device State**: Power/Data logical connections.
