# Tech Lead Handoff - Cycle P11

## Current Phase and Status
**Phase**: P11 - Intelligence and Functionality Fixes
**Status**: IN-PROGRESS
**Commit History**: P10 pending commit.

## Active Worker Assignments
- **Worker 1 (AUTO-LAYER-ACTIVATION-P11)**: Workflow automation via selection events.
- **Worker 2 (LOCATOR-COORDINATE-FIX-P11)**: Spatial accuracy (Screen-to-World conversion).
- **Worker 3 (CABLE-ROUTING-LOGIC-P11)**: Functional multi-segment drawing.

## Pending Issues / Blockers
- **Accuracy**: Room locator currently unusable due to coordinate mismatch (Worker 2 is fixing).
- **Workflow**: Layer management requires manual toggling even after device selection (Worker 1 is automating).

## Next Cycle Priorities (P12)
1. **Cable snapping**: Magnetic snapping to parallel runs.
2. **Device Connection points**: Logic for "docking" cables to devices.
