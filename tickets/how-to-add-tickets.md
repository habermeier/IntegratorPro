How to Add Tickets

1. Create a new markdown file in `tickets/` with a short, descriptive name.
2. Start the file with a `Date: YYYY-MM-DD` line.
3. Add an Executive Summary section with 2-4 sentences describing the intent.
4. Include a Scope section listing what is in and out of bounds.
5. Add Deliverables with concrete outputs or acceptance criteria.
6. Keep the ticket focused; split large efforts into multiple tickets.
