# Walkthrough - Refined Project Brief (Round 2)

I have applied the second round of refinements to the project brief in both the markdown document and the web application.

## Changes

### 1. Title Update
- **Simplified:** Changed "Project Brief: Automated Building Systems (ABS)" to just **"Project Brief"**.
- **Reason:** Removes formal/awkward titling.

### 2. Collaboration Model (Section 4)
- **Flexible Approach:** Removed the rigid "Suggested Lead" column, replacing it with **"Collaboration Approach"**.
- **Values:** Changed definitive assignments to **"Joint / Flexible"** or **"Owner prefers..."**.
- **Owner Capabilities:** Added a specific note highlighting the Owner's significant hands-on home improvement experience (framing, flooring, stairs) to validte the willingness to assist with LV wire pulling and drilling.

### 3. Application Sync
- **Updated Code:** All changes were applied to `components/CoverSheet.tsx` to ensure `localhost:3002` displays the latest version.

## Verification results

### Manual Verification
- Verified title is clean and simple.
- Verified Collaboration section emphasizes flexibility and mentions typical renovation skills.
- Confirmed web app component (`CoverSheet.tsx`) contains the exact text requested.
