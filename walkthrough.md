# Walkthrough - Refined Project Brief

I have updated the project brief `adjustments-and-cover-sheet.md` to incorporate the new "Ownership & Handoff Guidelines" and refine the "Collaboration Model", while ensuring the tone is collaborative and goal-oriented.

## Changes

### 1. Collaboration Model & Scope of Work (Section 4)
- **Softened Tone:** Adjusted language to "Owner is willing to contribute" rather than a hard commitment.
- **Clarified Roles:**
    - **Physical Panel Build:** Assigned to Pro Integrator.
    - **LV Wire Pulling:** Defined as Joint Effort (Owner willing to assist).
    - **Device Registration:** Assigned to Owner (bench setup).
    - **Commissioning:** collaborative approach (Owner leading Logic).

### 2. Ownership & Handoff Guidelines (Section 5)
- **Rewritten for Tone:** Changed title from "Requirements" to "Guidelines".
- **Goal-Oriented:** Replaced "Final payment contingent" and "Must be" with "Owner's goal is..." and "should remain/be".
- **Items:**
    - Hardware License (Dongle)
    - Master Data File (.knxproj)
    - Administrative Passwords
    - Transferability

### 3. Global Tone Polish
- **Removed:** "Strictly adhere", "Strictly professional", "Must support", "Must function".
- **Replaced with:** "Adhere", "Professional scope", "Designed to support", "Should function".

## Verification results

### Manual Verification
- Verified that the tone is collaborative and removed "demanding" language.
- Confirmed "Ownership" items are listed as standard fixtures.
- Confirmed "Collaboration" table matches the user's specific request for task division.
